                        student/tutee the answer(s) to a problem. Instead,
                        dialogue about what they do know/grasp and begin to work

                        </b>
                        : Teachers need to be aware of their personal learning

                        their tutee(s), allowing teachers to adjust their
                        methods appropriately. Students/tutees may also present
                        specific learning needs and/or disabilities. Teachers
                        should respond by providing resources to the student and
                        encouraging the student to access the services they

                        listening skills so that you can better assess tutees’
                        misconceptions and errors. Good listening skills will
                        also allow you to gauge the student’s understanding of
                        the material as you dialogue throughout your session.
                        You can then respond accordingly to assist your student

                        Seek to involve students in each step. You do not want
                        students to rely on you all the time. Encourage them to
                        put forth personal effort in your session. Provide
                        students with the means to find solutions and encourage

                        If a student struggles, continue to encourage him/her to
                        persist in the process.

                        important characteristics a teacher can demonstrate
                        toward their tutee(s). Never act annoyed toward a
                        student if they display a lack of understanding of the
                        material. Instead, act patiently with them and be aware

                        • <b>DON’T be condescending:</b> Avoid “talking down” to
                        a student. Be aware of your tone and your non-verbal
                        communication with tutees. Make sure that you always
                        treat the student as you would want to be treated; with
                        respect, kindness, and understanding.
                        <br />• <b>DON’T be discouraging:</b> Challenge your
                        tutee(s) to persevere and push towards excellence in
                        their coursework. Encourage students to practice strong
                        study skills. Don’t “bad-mouth” another tutor with or to
                        a student. Equip them to succeed in their work under
                        that instructor.
                        <br />• <b>DON’T be a distraction:</b> In your
                        session(s), make sure that you create an environment
                        conducive to learning. Remove any items that might cause
                        a distraction. Keep your cell phone on silent or vibrate
                        and place it in your bag, purse, or pocket. Don’t engage
                        in distracting behaviors. Watch your body language.
                        Remain focused on your student and the task(s) at hand.
                        <br />• <b>Key Job Responsibilities:</b>

                        enough time of 25 minutes. It will not be considered as
