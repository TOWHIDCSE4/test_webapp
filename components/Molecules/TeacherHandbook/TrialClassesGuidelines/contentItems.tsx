                        *Good morning! Welcome to iSpeak Online English School!
                        <br />
                        I am teacher [your name] but you can just call me, [your
                        nick name].

                        Is your name ____?
                        <br />
                        Is my English okay? Is it too fast for you?
                        <br />
                        • First, let me explain to you what we will do. I will
                        ask you some questions to help me give you a good
                        lesson. Then, we will study the book that you
                        chose/reserved. Finally, I will give you my comments
                        about your English skills.
                        <br />
                        Do not worry; I’m going to help you…

                        Alright, let’s start our lesson by having a very short
                        introduction.
                        <br />
                        Again, I am teacher [your name] but please call me,
                        [your nick name].
                        <br />
                        I have been teaching English for 6 years now and I have
                        taught Filipinos, Koreans, Japanese, Chinese and
                        Vietnamese students like you.
                        <br />
                        I am here to help you master the English language.
                        <br />
                        If you have questions about English, FEEL FREE to ask ME
                        ^__^ So, what about you, ______?
                        <br />
                        Ask basic questions that kids would understand. You can
                        ask about their:
                        <br />
                        • Age/Hobbies/Favorite subject in class/How many members
                        they have in their family, etc.
                        <br />• The Goal here is to set the mood of the student
                        for the trial class, and be at ease with you. It is
                        important to build rapport with the student and gain
                        their trust!

                        Here are some things that you should remember when
                        giving an advice/tips to students.
                        <br />
                        Example: <br />
                        - You need to practice pronouncing words with the /l/
                        and are /r/ sounds.
                        <br />
                        - You need to practice expressing your thoughts in
                        complete sentences.
                        <br />
                        Example: <br />- Learning English takes time and
                        practice. If you really want to learn the language you
                        have to use it as often as possible. iSpeak teachers can
                        help you with that.

                        Vietnamese parents do CARE A LOT what teachers comment,
                        and mark to their children (including setting their
                        starting level. We need to be more generous in giving
                        marks and levels.
                        <br />
                        Majority of Online English schools in Vietnam provide
                        fast progress for children with marks like 7-9.
                        <br />
                        If their PARENTS are happy with their children's
                        progress, they will be more than willing to enroll with
                        us Vietnamese children are typically shy when speaking
                        English, especially with foreigners.
                        <br />
                        Every teacher needs to do is to set a very friendly and
                        conducive environment with regards to teaching the
                        students so that they will speak, and learn English with
                        fun and excitement. <br />
                        Once they progress and developed their English skills
                        with us, they will tell their parents and viola!
                        REMEMBER to SPEAK SLOWLY on your FIRST CLASS with them!

                        Gauging the student’s level is an integral part of the
                        learning process. It allows the teacher to adapt the
                        lesson based on each learner’s level of English
                        proficiency and what book to use for the class.
                        Remember, students have different reasons for studying
                        English and when their needs are not met, there is a
                        possibility that they will not continue studying with

                        <br />
                        - Ask open-ended questions.
                        <br />
                        - Give follow up questions.
                        <br />
                        - Give pronunciation and grammar corrections.
                        <br />
                        - Feed new vocabulary by using synonyms and antonyms
                        <br />
                        - Apply Instruction checking questions (ICQ) to check
                        whether the student is giving or saying the right answe
                        <br />
                        - Comprehension check questions (CCQ) to double check if
                        the student understands the concept.
                        <br />
                        Example:
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Teacher: What did you have for dessert?
                        <br />
                        Student: I drink cake.
                        <br />
                        Teacher: Did you say drink? Are you sure? (ICQ)
                        <br />
                        Student: Oh. I mean eat.
                        <br />
                        Teacher: Great. Remember, we use eat for solid food like
                        cake and drink for liquid like water or juice. Now,
                        let’s try again. Do you eat milk? (CCQ)
                        <br />
                        Student: No. I drink milk.

                        even difficult, situations.
                        <br />
                        - Can exploit a wide range of simple language flexibly
                        to express much of what he/she wants.
                        <br />
                        - Shows good control of elementary vocabulary but major
                        errors still occur when expressing more complex thoughts
                        or handling unfamiliar topics and situations.
                        <br />
                        - Communicates with reasonable accuracy in familiar
                        contexts; generally good control though with noticeable
                        mother tongue influence.

                        - Errors occur, but it is clear what he/she is trying to
                        express.

                        - Can maintain a conversation or discussion but may
                        sometimes be difficult to follow whentrying to say
                        exactly what he/she would like to.
                        <br />
                        - Can put over a point of view clearly, but has

                        - Challenge students and stimulate critical thinking by
                        asking open-ended questions.
                        <br />
                        - Ask follow up questions.
                        <br />- Give corrections for accuracy, word function and

                        1/ Check the student's study record at iSpeak before the
                        class
                        <br />
                        2/ Be friendly and nice. Vietnamese children are
                        typically shy when speaking English to teachers,
                        especially foreign teachers.
                        <br />
                        3/ Teachers are required to correct pronunciation for
                        children during the class.
                        <br />
                        4/ Please correct the sentences which children can not
                        express or express wrongly. Then, ask student to repeat
                        the correct sentences
                        <br />
                        5/ For children aged below 9 and having started learning
                        English, teachers are required to speak and teach VERY
                        SLOWLY, focusing on SIMPLE words, sentences and
                        pronunciation. You don’t have to finish all exercises in
                        the unit.
                        <br />
                        6/ Avoid following exactly what written in textbook
                        (it's so boring)
                        <br />
                        7/ Think about ways to encourage student express their
                        speaking skill
                        <br />
                        8/ Write memo after each class, the memo must be
                        encouraging but still show few weaknesses that the
                        student needs to improve.

                        Please forward the recorded clip to your Skype’s Support
                        Group so that we can review and advise the students and
                        parents about their level and which course should they
                        register.

                        3. WRITE MEMO
                        <br />
                        This is VERY IMPORTANT to evaluate correctly the level
                        of the students and identify their strenghts and
                        weaknesses. Based on your evaluation, the students will
                        decide to enroll and be a regular students. Therefore,
                        please write the memo for trial as DETAIL and SPECIFIC
                        as possible.
