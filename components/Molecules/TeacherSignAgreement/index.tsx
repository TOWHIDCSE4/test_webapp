                advance who you are meeting and which course(s) your student has

                student/tutee the answer(s) to a problem. Instead, dialogue
                about what they do know/grasp and begin to work from there.

                    DO Be Mindful of Learning Styles &amp; Learning Needs
                </strong>
                : Teachers need to be aware of their personal learning styles
                and be able to assess the core learning styles of their
                tutee(s), allowing teachers to adjust their methods
                appropriately. Students/tutees may also present specific
                learning needs and/or disabilities. Teachers should respond by
                providing resources to the student and encouraging the student
                to access the services they need. Teachers are always encouraged
                to consult with iSpeak staff in the endeavor to connect
                students.

        <p>
            <span>
                • <strong>DO Be a Good Listener</strong>: Practice active
                listening skills so that you can better assess tutees’
                misconceptions and errors. Good listening skills will also allow
                you to gauge the student’s understanding of the material as you
                dialogue throughout your session. You can then respond
                accordingly to assist your student at their point of need.

        </p>
        <p>
            <span>
                • <strong>DO Be an Encourager</strong>: Encourage students to be
                active participants in their own learning process. Seek to
                involve students in each step. You do not want students to rely
                on you all the time. Encourage them to put forth personal effort
                in your session. Provide students with the means to find
                solutions and encourage them to use those tools to produce of
                positive result. If the student struggles, continue to encourage
                them to persist in the process.

                • <strong>DO Be Patient</strong>: This is one of the most
                important characteristics a teacher can demonstrate toward their
                tutee(s). Never act annoyed toward a student if they display a
                lack of understanding of the material. Instead, act patiently
                with them and be aware of their pacing needs.

                • <strong>DON’T be condescending</strong>: Avoid “talking down”
                to a student. Be aware of your tone and your non-verbal
                communication with tutees. Make sure that you always treat the
                student as you would want to be treated; with respect, kindness,
                and understanding.

        <p>
            <span>
                • <strong>DON’T be discouraging</strong>: Challenge your
                tutee(s) to persevere and push towards excellence in their
                coursework. Encourage students to practice strong study skills.
                Don’t “bad-mouth” another tutor with or to a student. Equip them
                to succeed in their work under that instructor.

        <p>
            <span>
                • <strong>DON’T be a distraction</strong>: In your session(s),
                make sure that you create an environment conducive to learning.
                Remove any items that might cause a distraction. Keep your cell
                phone on silent or vibrate and place it in your bag, purse, or
                pocket. Don’t engage in distracting behaviors. Watch your body
